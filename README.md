This is a simplified script designed to help hackers or penetration testers stay focused and proceed step-by-step, ensuring they do not perform website penetration tests randomly. It helps the tester to avoid the feeling that they might have missed something or overlooked a potential vulnerability. This script is open-source, intentionally so, because if anyone wants to add other vulnerabilities they are searching for, they can do so freely. I will also update it in the future. Additionally, the script has the feature of asking if you found something and if you want to save it to a file. Many of us want to save a domain, link, or other findings for future reference. I hope this tool is useful to you and helps you in your work. Thank you. This tool is my creation, and I have put effort into it. I hope it benefits you and meets your approval. Thank you.
